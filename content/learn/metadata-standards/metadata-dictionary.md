## Metadata Dictionary

The five Metadata Dictionary sections list the current set of metadata fields used to describe datasets in the Human Cell Atlas. The fields in each section represent different parts of an experiment: A *biomaterial* (e.g. a tissue sample) can undergo a *process* (e.g. dissociation) to produce another biomaterial (e.g. a sample of dissociated cells) or a set of output *files* (e.g. 10X fastq files). The process that was actually executed follows a specific *protocol* (e.g. a 10X protocol), and everything contributes to the overall *project* (e.g. understanding cell types of the human heart).
