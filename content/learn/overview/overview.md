## Learn how to use the Data Portal

The *Learn* section is geared for users of all backgrounds and will provide you with a deep understanding of the Data Coordination Platform and how data flows through it.  Our detailed User Guides explain the processes of accessing data using the data browser or the command line interface. There are guides describing our analysis pipelines, portability service, and the quality control and best practices methods we employ for pipeline building. The guides will also help you get started with our collection of portals and visualization tools built by the community, and will introduce you to the process of contributing data to the Human Cell Atlas through the DCP. 

This *Learn* section also contains extensive information about the Metadata Standard, including a dictionary of metadata fields, an overview of the metadata structure, and a discussion of design and implementation choices. We encourage you to read this to understand our metadata, especially if you are a data contributor or data consumer, or you are seeking to align your work with our metadata standards. If you are planning an experiment that you intend to contribute to the HCA, collecting the appropriate metadata will enable us to make your data maximally searchable in the data portal and thus widely accessed by users.

If you are a developer, we encourage you to first explore the User Guides in this section for preliminary information to help you get started, and then visit the *Develop* section for developer-oriented guides and API documentation. Please email us at mailto:data-help@humancellatlas.org if you have questions.
