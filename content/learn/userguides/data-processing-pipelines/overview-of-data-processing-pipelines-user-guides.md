## Overview of Data Processing Pipelines User Guides
This page is an introduction to the guides in this section, which are designed to help you explore the Data Processing Pipeline Service in detail. Our documentation is dynamic and will be updated and expanded as single cell technologies change. We'd like to hear from you; please contact us with your questions or suggestions for improvements.

### Data Processing Workflows
[Smart-seq2 Workflow in Detail](/learn/userguides/data-processing-pipelines/smart-seq2-workflow-in-detail): A description of our standardized, full transcript, single cell transcriptomics pipeline for Smart-seq2 data.

[Optimus Prime Workflow in Detail](/learn/userguides/data-processing-pipelines/optimus-prime-workflow-in-detail); A description of our 3' single cell transcriptomics pipeline.

### Workflow Standards
[QC Metrics](/learn/userguides/data-processing-pipelines/qc-mertics): Discover which quality control metrics we generate while processing the data.

[File Formats](/learn/userguides/data-processing-pipelines/file-formats): We use GA4GH and *de facto* file standards as much as possible; you can read more here.

### Advanced Workflow Engineering
[Pipeline Portability](/learn/userguides/data-processing-pipelines/pipeline-portability): The ability to run workflows in your own environment is important to us; here we describe our nascent service. Note that additional guides about the Portability Service can be found in the *Develop* section.
