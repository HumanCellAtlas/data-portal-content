## Overview of Tertiary Analysis

"Teriary analysis" is a term generally referring to analysis outside of the data portal. This may refer to downloading HCA data and using it in *de facto* software tools or interacting with a portal that communicates transparently with the Data Portal. These solutions are not built by the HCA DCP implementation team but are solutions we foster and support.

Soon, we will turn on the Data Portal for initial use. During that time, we will begin to develop this space to grow into a collection of guides on how to use HCA data and perform analysis, as a data scientist, using software that is compatable with the DCP system.
