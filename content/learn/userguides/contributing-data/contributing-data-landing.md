## Overview of Contributing Data

**REMOVE THIS PARAGRAPH WHEN PAGE GOES LIVE:** This is the only page that will give users information about how to contribute data to the HCA at this time. 

### Who can contribute to the Human Cell Atlas

Anyone with openly consented human single cell sequencing data can contribute to the Human Cell Atlas.

### When can data be contributed to the Human Cell Atlas

We are currently working with pilot data contributors and are not accepting further projects. If you would like to be part of the next round of data contributors, please contact us at data-help@humancellatlas.org.

### What is needed to contribute data to the Human Cell Atlas

1. Sequencing data
    - fastq formatted data files demultiplexed by sample
    - 10X or SmartSeq2 data files (if other, please contact us)
1. Metadata spreadsheet
    - Please contact us for a template metadata spreadsheet
1. Open consent to make data and metadata public

### What happens when data are submitted to the Human Cell Atlas

1. Something happens
1. Something else happens
1. Only SS2 human data will launch an analysis pipeline
1. Find project in the Data Browser
1. Profit!

## Remaining questions

1. What should we tell people who have imaging data?
1. What should we tell people who have non-human or non-10x/SS2 data?
1. What should we tell people about what type of analysis/results file they can expect and when?
