## Using the CLI to Access Data
### Installation
It is reccommended that the CLI be run in a virtual environment to be sure of which dependency versions you are using. A common utility for creating and managing vritual environment is `virtualenv`. Installation instructions for `virtualenv` can be found online. In Mac OS High Sierra, one might use

`sudo pip install virtualenv`

`virtualenv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

Now follow the instructions [heere](https://hca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to install the CLI. That link also covers basic instructions for using each of the available CLI commands. This page reviews a specific example for how the CLI can be used to download data.
