A third method of finding data is by writing Python scripts that search the data directly from a software program. 

The Quick Start Guide shows how to download data via either the **Explore** browser or via the CLI. It also includes some pointers to other tools that can be used once the data of interest has been identified.

The **Using the Data Browser to Access Data** section describes how to download selected subsections of data.

The **Using the CLI to Access Data** section details how to use each of the commands available in the Data Store CLI.
