## Overview of Secondary Analysis User Guides
The guides described below are designed to help you explore the Secondary Analysis Service in detail. This documentation is dynamic and will be updated and expanded as single cell technologies change. We'd like to hear from you; please contact us with your questions or suggestions for improvements.

### Data Processing Workflows
Smart-seq2 Workflow in Detail: A description of our standardized, full transcript, single cell transcriptomics pipeline.

Optimus Prime Workflow in Detail; A description of our 3' single cell transcriptomics pipeline.

### Workflow Standards
QC Metrics: Discover which quality control metrics we generate while processing the data.

File Formats: We use GA4GH and *de facto* file standards as much as possible; you can read more here.

### Advanced Workflow Engineering
Pipeline Portability: The ability to run workflows in your own environment is important to us; here we describe our nascent service. Note that additional guides about the portability service can be found in the *Develop* section.

Workflow Best Practices: Engineering great pipelines is a complex endeavor and we do this in an iterative manner, learning best practices as we go. If you are a developer, check out our guides on [Pipeline Development](develop/development-guides/pipeline-development-guide) and [Contributing a pipeline to the HCA DCP](develop/development-guides/contributing-a-pipeline-to-the-hca-dcp) in the *Develop* section of this site.
