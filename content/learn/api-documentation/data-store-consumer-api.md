## Data Store API

The [HCA Data Storage System](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-store) (DSS) is a replicated data storage system designed for hosting large sets of scientific experimental data on 
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Google Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/). 

The DSS exposes a [REST API](https://dss.data.humancellatlas.org/), and provides [Python bindings]((https://hca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) for that API.
