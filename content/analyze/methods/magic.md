Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells ([MAGIC](https://pypi.org/project/magic-impute/)) is an algorithm for denoising and imputation of single cells applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as described in Van Dijk D et al. (2018), Recovering Gene Interactions from Single-Cell Data Using Data Diffusion, Cell https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30724-4.
