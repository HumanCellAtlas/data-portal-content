[PHATE](https://pypi.org/project/phate/) is a tool for visualizing high dimensional single-cell data with natural progressions or trajectories. PHATE uses a novel conceptual framework for learning and visualizing the manifold inherent to biological systems in which smooth transitions mark the progressions of cells from one state to another, as described in Moon, van Dijk, Wang et al. (2017), Visualizing Transitions and Structure for Biological Data Exploration, bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/28/120378.
