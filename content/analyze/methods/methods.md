##  Methods
The HCA Methods Resistry lists tools for performing analyses involving scRNA-seq, scDNA-seq, in situ transcriptomics, multi-modal and other computational biology approaches. 

These solutions are not built by the HCA DCP implementation team but are solutions we foster and support. 

You can use these methods packages by following the installation and usage instructions in the method's detail page.  Portal developers can also find instructions for integrating these methods into an app on each method's detail page.
