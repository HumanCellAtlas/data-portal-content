## About Visualization Components
Visualization components for Human Cell Atlas are JavaScript modules that enable analysis through interactive data exploration on the web.  This registry lists packages for such components.

You can use these visualization components in portals for HCA data, or you can try out interactive demos in the component's detail page.  Portal developers can also find instructions for integrating these visualizations into a web app on each component's detail page.

If you are a visualization engineer and want to add your software to this list, [submit your package](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/data-portal-content/issues/new/?with-visualization-component-package-submission-issue-template)!
