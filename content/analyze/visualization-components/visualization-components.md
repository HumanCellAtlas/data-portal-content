## Visualization Packages
The HCA Visualization Package Registry lists JavaScript modules that enable analysis through interactive data exploration on the web.  

 These solutions are not built by the HCA DCP implementation team but are solutions we foster and support. 

Portal developers can find instructions for integrating these visualizations into a web app on each component's detail page. Sample code showing a minimal reference implementation is available for some components by clicking on their "mashup" badge.
