title: "UCSC Xena | Brian Craft, Mary Goldman, Jingchun Zhu, David Haussler"
subTitle: UCSC Xena is a web-based visual integration and exploration tool for multi-omic data and associated meta-data and annotations. Our primary visualization is the Xena Visual Spreadsheet. Analogous to an office spreadsheet application, it is a visual representation of a data grid where each column is a slice of genomic or phenotypic data (e.g. gene expression or cell type), and each row is a single entity (e.g. a single cell). Researchers interactively build the spreadsheet column by column, enabling the discovery of patterns and correlations among genomic parameters.""
