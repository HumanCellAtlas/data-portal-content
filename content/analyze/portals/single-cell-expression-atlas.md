### Single Cell Expression Atlas | Gene Expression Team at EMBL-EBI, Irene Papatheodorou

Single Cell Expression Atlas supports research in single cell transcriptomics. The Atlas annotates publicly available single cell RNA-Seq experiments with ontology identifiers and re-analyses them using standardised pipelines available through iRAP, our RNA-Seq analysis toolkit. The browser enables visualisation of clusters of cells, their annotations and supports searches for gene expression within and across studies.
