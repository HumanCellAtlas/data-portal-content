### How to submit data

#### Introduction
Currently the process for data submission to the HCA DCP happens in close coordination with an HCA data wrangler. The DCP is hard at work implementing an intuitive user interface that will replace this process in the future.

#### The process

1. **Communicate with an HCA DCP data wrangler**. In the early phase of the HCA DCP, data contributors will work closely with HCA DCP data wranglers to assemble a data submission.

1. **Assemble metadata**. Working with HCA DCP data wranglers, data submitters will gather, assemble, and review all metadata that is part of the data submission.

1. **Submit data files**. With the help of the HCA DCP data wranglers, data submitters will use the HCA CLI to upload their data files to the cloud.

1. **Confirm for publication.** After an HCA DCP data wrangler has finalized the data submission, everything will be sent to the data submitter for review and confirmation.
