# Data Suitability

The first phase of the HCA will profile tens of millions of human cells, isolated and in their tissue context from major tissues of healthy research participants. This effort will combine many different types of cellular resolution data including single cell RNA-Seq, single nucleus profiling of frozen samples, and spatial analysis of cells in the context of tissues. Based on this, the HCA considers five criteria to assess the suitability of a dataset for building the Atlas now.
