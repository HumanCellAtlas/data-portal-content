## What is the DCP?

The Data Coordination Platform (DCP) is an open source, cloud-based platform developed to organize, standardize, and make accessible the data that constitute the Human Cell Atlas (HCA).  This platform has been constructed by a consortium of scientists, engineers, and designers from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Broad Institute (Broad), and University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). As new technologies emerge, the DCP will develop pipelines and data formats to process the new data types to deliver meaningful results for analysis. The components that comprise the DCP platform and the  pipelines run in the platform are all modular, enabling their use in diverse environments outside the DCP with HCA or non-HCA datasets.

To coordinate the vast amounts of data needed to build a true human cell atlas, the DCP has been engineered to offer the most current technologies and methodologies, including:

* many modes of data ingest through a stateful user-friendly dynamic ingest UI
* rich, extensible, and validated metadata
* open and standardized data access APIs
* multi-platform cloud-scalable storage available to scientists in the most popular cloud-based computing environments
* cloud-native, scalable data processing pipelines reviewed by world experts
* pipelines that are portable to outside the project for extended use
* a verbose QC metrics suite
* a flexible matrix service for dynamic data delivery
* a multi-faceted file browsing UI enabling sharing with collaborators

We invite you to use this data portal to submit your data or analyze data from other laboratories and contact us with your feedback or questions.
