## About the Data Coordination Platform (DCP)

The HCA Data Coordination Platform (DCP) is an open source, cloud-based platform developed to organize, standardize, and make accessible the data that constitute the Human Cell Atlas (HCA).

This platform has been constructed by a consortium of scientists, engineers, and designers from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Broad Institute (Broad), and University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). 

As new technologies emerge, the DCP will develop pipelines and data formats to process the new data types to deliver meaningful results for analysis. The components that comprise the DCP platform and the  pipelines run in the platform are all modular, enabling their use in diverse environments outside the DCP with HCA or non-HCA datasets.

We invite you to use this data portal to submit your data or access data from other laboratories and contact us with your feedback or questions.
