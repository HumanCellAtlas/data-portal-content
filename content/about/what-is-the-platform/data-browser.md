## Data Browser
The Data Browser provides a web user interface to quickly filter data stored in the Data Store. It is not an analysis or visualization tool itself. Rather the Data Browser focuses on finding data in the Data Store to enable users to download for analysis in other systems. The Data Browser is part of the overall Data Portal.

### Functional Overview
The main uses of the data browser are to find data and then facilitate the further analysis of that data. Note that it is not the purpose of the Data Browser to actually analyze the data, just to pass data to other systems that will do further analysis or [visualizations](/analyze/portals/visualization-portals). 

#### Finding Data
The user interface provides a faceted view of the data in the Data Store. You can select data of interest by ticking the checkboxes on attributes of the data that interest them, such as organ type or part, process used, type of donor, characteristics of the specimen, which project the data is part of, and many more characteristics. You can also search directly for data with certain attributes by simply typing the characteristic in the search box.

#### Downloading Data
Once you have selected a set of data you can press the download button on the UI. A manifest of the selected files will be downloaded. You can download the actual data files by the using the [HCA cli](/learn/userguides/accessing-data/using-the-cli-to-access-data).
