## Data Browser
The Data Browser, accessible from the *Explore* link, provides a web user interface to quickly filter data stored in the Data Store. It is not an analysis or visualization tool itself. Rather the Data Browser is used to find data in the Data Store and then download it for analysis in other systems. The Data Browser is part of the overall *Data Portal*.

### Functional Overview
The main uses of the Data Browser are to browse data and identify desired data sets for subsequent download and analysis. While the Data Browser itself does not perform analyses, it can pass data to other applications that do. Please see our *Analyze* section for information and links to [visualization portals](/analyze/portals/visualization-portals), [components](/analyze/visualization-components/visualization-components), and [methods](/analyze/methods/methods) developed by the community for analysis of single cell data. 

#### Finding Data
The Data Browser user interface provides a faceted view of the data in the Data Store. You can select data of interest by ticking the checkboxes by the various attributes, such as organ type or part, process used, type of donor, characteristics of the specimen, the project associated with the data, and many more characteristics. You can also search directly for data with certain attributes by simply typing the characteristic in the search box.

#### Downloading Data
Once you have selected a set of data, use the Download button to begin the download process. A manifest of the selected files will first be downloaded. You can then download the actual data files by the using the [HCA CLI](/learn/userguides/accessing-data/using-the-cli-to-access-data). Detailed instructions about accessing data are available from the User Guides tab of the *Learn* section.
