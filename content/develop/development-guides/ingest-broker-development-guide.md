## Ingest Broker Development Guide

We envisage that Brokers will expose those parts of the Ingest API that it makes sense for a Submitter to call directly (e.g. data file upload). Brokers may therefore expose REST API functions to perform:

* List / view Metadata Schemas.
* Start / submit / cancel a submission.
* Upload / reupload JSON Metadata Files.
* Get state of a submission, including metadata and data validation.
