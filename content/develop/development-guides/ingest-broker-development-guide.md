# Ingest Broker Development Guide

We envisage that Brokers will expose those parts of the Ingest API that it makes sense for a Submitter to call directly (e.g. data file upload). Brokers may therefore expose REST API functions to perform:

* List / view Metadata Schemas.
* Start / submit / cancel a submission.
* Upload / reupload JSON Metadata Files.
* Get state of a submission, including metadata and data validation.

## Submission Broker

All data that are made available for the Human Cell Atlas first go through the process of ingestion through the Ingest API. Submission brokers take care of storing, processing, and (if needed) converting submissions to ensure that data are interoperable. A submission refers to a collection of scientific files and the metadata about them, contributed to the HCA by scientific teams around the world.
