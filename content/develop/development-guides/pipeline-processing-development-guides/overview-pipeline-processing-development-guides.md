## Pipeline Processing Development Guides

We provide pipeline development guides, summarized below, to help you design and build your own single cell data processing pipelines. 

[Best Practices for Building Data Processing Pipelines](https://dev.data.humancellatlas.org/develop/development-guides/pipeline-processing-development-guides/workflow-best-practices): Engineering great pipelines is a complex endeavor and we do this in an iterative manner, learning best practices as we go. 

[Quick Start for Building Pipelines](https://dev.data.humancellatlas.org/develop/development-guides/pipeline-processing-development-guides/pipeline-development-guide): Learn about the variety of resources that have helped us with our pipeline building projects. Also, scroll down the page to find information about DCP-hosted meetings, events, and Slack channels you can join.

[Pipeline Testing Guide](https://dev.data.humancellatlas.org/develop/development-guides/pipeline-processing-development-guides/testing-pipelines): Test whether your pipeline can execute to completion  and produce the expected outputs in HCA DCP, as well as other, execution environments.

[Contributing a Pipeline to the HCA DCP](https://dev.data.humancellatlas.org/develop/development-guides/pipeline-processing-development-guides/contributing-a-pipeline-to-the-hca-dcp): Please consider submitting your pipeline for use by the DCP to analyze data from the community!

[Adding an Environment to the Portability Service](https://dev.data.humancellatlas.org/develop/development-guides/pipeline-processing-development-guides/adding-an-environment-to-the-portability-service): If youâ€™re developing a new environment for running our pipelines, this guide will help you test that environment in our portability service.
