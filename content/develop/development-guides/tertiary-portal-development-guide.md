# Creating Solutions using the DCP

The Human Cell Atlas Data Coordination Platform holds much potential to support and enrich solutions for single cell genomics. We hope this will point you to the resources to leverage to enable your creativity.

## General Description

We provide several computational solutions to leverage in building products. We have several REST APIs for programmatic inteface, an open metadata schema to leverage, cloud-native pipelines that are portable to multiple environments, and standardized domain specific methodology and visualizations. We provide a couple vignettes as examples of interacting with different aspects of the DCP.

## Working with Ingest

**Ingest API** Ingest provides a programmatic API for submitting data. This may be useful for example for LIMs integration solutions. This does require authentication and would require contacting the ingest team.

## Learning More About Metadata

**HCA Metadata** The HCA metadata schema is a curated description of the entities and thier relationships captured in HCA data. The metadata schema public to review on GitHub. The metadata schema is also extensible and open for changes through pull requestions.

## Accessing the Datastore

**Consumer API** Data in the HCA data store can be accessed programmatically through the consumer API. This interface includes both a REST API end point and a CLI (python).
