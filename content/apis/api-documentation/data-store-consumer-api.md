## Data Store API

The HCA Data Storage System (DSS) is a replicated data storage system designed for hosting large sets of scientific experimental data on 
Amazon S3 and Google Storage. 

The DSS exposes a [REST API](https://dss.data.humancellatlas.org/), with [Python bindings](https://hca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allowing client applications to:

1. Search for data and metadata.
1. Download data and metadata.
1. Manage subscriptions for notifications of data update events.
